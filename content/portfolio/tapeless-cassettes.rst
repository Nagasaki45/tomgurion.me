A CruftFest 2016 project / an assignment to the Interactive Digital Multimedia Techniques (ESC742P) module, Media and Arts Technology, Queen Mary University of London.

This project uses modified audio cassettes as controllers for an interactive and collaborative musical interface.
It invites users to manually turn the cassettes wheels, with their pinky or a BIC® pen, to control the speed of the music.
The interaction is simple and intuitive - the higher the speed of the wheel, the faster the music.
Multiple cassettes enable a group of users to play together, letting each one to control different track in the music.
The resulted sounds fluctuate in speed and in pitch, and therefore cannot be synchronized.
The lack of synchronization, which is unusual in familiar music, suggest different types of interactions with the musical materials and between players.
