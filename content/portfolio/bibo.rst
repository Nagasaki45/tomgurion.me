bibo is a command line reference manager with a single source of truth: the .bib file.
It is inspired by `beets <https://beets.readthedocs.io/>`_.

- It gives you control over your files. They are not hidden in some obscure database, hence easy to backup, share, etc.
- It's a thin editor of .bib files, so no need to export your bibliography anywhere.
- It's extensible with plugins.
- It's a command line tool. What not to ❤️?
